# Hello Hooman 👋 !

I'm pretty much sure you got here by mistake, this is a personal site full of notes that I use mainly as a brain dump and the result of a huge number of sleepless night navigating the internet.

As such, **it may change a lot**, so you shoud assume its content is completely volatile (including the github repo you can find in the upper right corner of the page since I have a thing for rebases).

<p align="center"><img inline src="images/shrug.png" title="¯\_(ツ)_/¯"/></p>

In the future I may consider some parts of it as worth publishing and I will probably dedicate a subdomain of [toniogela.dev](https://toniogela.dev) to them.

If you're in the mood to chat, or suggest me to persist specific parts of this mess, ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/toniogela).
